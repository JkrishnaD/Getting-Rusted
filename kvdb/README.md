# ðŸ§  kvdb â€” A Simple Persistent Key-Value Store in Rust

`kvdb` is a lightweight, CLI-based key-value database written in Rust. It is designed for learning and experimentation.

Inspired by LevelDB and RocksDB, `kvdb` starts with a simple in-memory map + Write-Ahead Log (WAL) for durability and evolves into an LSM-tree-based persistent store.

- It uses a `HashMap` for fast in-memory operations and persists data to disk using a Write-Ahead Log (WAL) for crash recovery.
- The CLI interface allows basic commands like `set`, `get`, and `delete`.
- The data is stored in a `.kvdb/` directory, making it easy to manage.
- The architecture is modular, allowing for future extensions like SSTables, compaction, and more.

---

## Features

- Fast in-memory reads and writes (via `HashMap`)
- Write-Ahead Logging for crash recovery
- Clean CLI interface for basic commands
- Data persisted on disk in `.kvdb/` directory
- Modular design (can be extended into SSTables, compaction, and more)

---

## How It Works

- **SET key value**
  Stores the key-value pair in memory and appends it to the WAL file.

- **GET key**
  Fetches the value from memory (or eventually SSTables).

- **DELETE key**
  Marks the key as deleted and appends a tombstone to the WAL.

- **Recovery**
  On startup, the engine replays the WAL to reconstruct the memtable.

## Usage

#### Add a key

`./kvdb set name "Jaya Krishna"`

#### Retrieve a key

`./kvdb get name > "Jaya Krishna"`

#### Delete a key

`./kvdb delete name`

#### Try to get again

`./kvdb get name > null`
